## Platform

Implemented in python.
As Python is cross-platform, it can be run on Windows, Linux-based or Mac systems. The only thing you need to have installed is `python3`.

## Dependencies



The dependencies are in the `requirements.txt` file.

If you use `virtualenv` you need to create/activate it first.
Them, you can install the dependencies using `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> NOTE: We recommend use `venv` to your python projects.
